GA4GH GKS Specification  v1

Primitive Data Types
  CURIE
  Sequence String  (actual string of residues)

Complex Data Types
  - Composed Sequence  (? should these be identifiable or not?)
    Sequence Expression
    
  - Interval  (DEPRECATED)  this is not needed.
  
Value Object Components  (identifiable types)
  Strict value objects that can be identified computably
  - Contextual Entities
    - Sequence (CURIE digest of Sequence String)  <-- Refget defines this

    - Location
        Sequence Location
            sequence interval gets rolled up into sequence location
        Chromosome Location
            cytoband interval gets rolled up into chromosome location

    - Features    <-- SA + VR  
    - Named Locations <-- SA + VR

    - Variation  <-- this is built from VRS 1.2+   VR  
      - Systemic
          CNV   <-- This mixes SequenceExpression with identifiable items like Feature and MolecularVariation
          Genotype
      - Molecular
          Allele
          Sequence Junction  (per AHW)
          Haplotype
      - Utility
          Variation Text

  - Categorical Location  
    - Complex Location
    - Canonical Location

  - Categorical Variation
    - Complex Variation
    - Canonical Variation
    - Located Molecular Consquence Variation
    - Funcation Consequence Variation
    - Gene Fusions

  - TODOs value object descriptors that need value objects....

Value Object Descriptor Components  (VA, SA, VR , VRSATILE)
  Exchange wrapper components
  - 


Annotation Components  (VA, SA)
  Statements for knowledge and other complex results
  - Proposition Types
  - Clinically Significant Knowlegde
  - Study Results

  - Be careful when you decide to use a VO vs VOD.
